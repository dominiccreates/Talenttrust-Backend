# API Key Authentication

This document describes the API key authentication system implemented for TalentTrust Backend.

## Overview

API keys provide a secure way for internal services and external integrations to access the TalentTrust API without requiring user authentication. API keys are separate from JWT user authentication and can be used for service-to-service communication.

## Admin Scopes

API keys used for admin-only surfaces (DLQ inspection, deploy operations) require one of the following scopes:

| Scope | Permits |
|-------|---------|
| `deploy:*` | All deployment operations (switch, rollback, status) |
| `*` | Full access (admin keys only) |
| `jobs:admin` | DLQ list, replay, and metrics |
| `jobs:*` | All job-related admin operations |

## Protected Endpoints

The following endpoints require either a JWT with `admin` role or an API key with one of the admin scopes above:

- `GET /api/v1/jobs/dlq` — List failed jobs in the DLQ
- `POST /api/v1/jobs/dlq/reprocess` — Replay a failed job
- `GET /api/v1/admin/deploy/status` — Get deployment state
- `POST /api/v1/admin/deploy/switch-green` — Promote green to active
- `POST /api/v1/admin/deploy/rollback` — Roll back to blue

## Features

- **Secure Generation**: Cryptographically generated 32-byte hex keys
- **Hashed Storage**: Keys are hashed at rest using PBKDF2 with salt
- **Scoping**: Fine-grained permissions using resource:action format
- **Constant-Time Comparison**: `crypto.timingSafeEqual` prevents timing attacks on key verification
- **Rotation**: Safe key rotation without changing the key ID
- **Expiration**: Optional expiration dates for temporary access
- **Audit Trail**: Last usage tracking for security monitoring
- **Deactivation**: Secure deactivation of compromised or unused keys

## API Key Format

API keys are 64-character hex strings:
```
abc123def456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456
```

## Usage

API keys should be sent in the `X-API-Key` header:
```http
GET /api/v1/contracts
X-API-Key: abc123def456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456
```

## Scope Format

API keys use a flexible scoping system with the following formats:

### Exact Match
```
contracts:read    # Can read contracts only
users:create       # Can create users only
```

### Wildcard Actions
```
contracts:*        # Can perform any action on contracts
*:read            # Can read any resource
```

### Full Wildcard
```
*                 # Can access everything (admin keys only)
```

## API Endpoints

## Security Considerations

### Key Storage
- API keys are hashed using PBKDF2 with 10,000 iterations
- Each key has a unique 16-byte salt
- Hashes are stored in the format `salt:hash`

### Key Rotation
- Rotation generates a new key while keeping the same ID
- Old keys become invalid immediately upon rotation
- No downtime during rotation process

### Expiration
- Optional expiration dates for temporary access
- Expired keys are automatically rejected
- Expired keys are deactivated on first access attempt

## Audit Trail
- Last usage timestamp is updated on successful authentication
- Helps identify unused or suspicious keys
- Useful for security monitoring and compliance

## Best Practices

### Key Management
1. **Use descriptive names** - Clearly identify the purpose of each key
2. **Apply minimal scope** - Grant only necessary permissions
3. **Set expiration dates** - Use temporary keys when possible
4. **Rotate regularly** - Establish a rotation schedule for production keys
5. **Monitor usage** - Review last usage timestamps regularly

### Security
1. **Never expose keys** - API keys are only shown once during creation
2. **Use environment variables** - Store keys securely in production
3. **Implement rate limiting** - Protect against key abuse
4. **Monitor for anomalies** - Set up alerts for unusual usage patterns

### Integration
1. **Handle 401 errors** - Gracefully handle invalid/expired keys
2. **Implement retry logic** - Handle temporary network issues
3. **Log usage** - Track which services use which keys
4. **Use appropriate scope** - Request only necessary permissions

## Lifecycle Overview

1. **Creation** – A client calls the `POST /api/v1/api-keys` endpoint. The server generates a cryptographically random 32‑byte key, hashes it with a unique salt using PBKDF2, stores the `salt:hash` pair, and returns the **plain‑text key** **once** in the response. The plain key must be stored securely by the client; it is never persisted by the server.
2. **Usage** – Clients include the key in the `X‑API‑Key` header on each request. The middleware extracts the header, verifies the key against the stored hash, updates `last_used_at`, and enforces any required scopes via `requireApiKeyScope`.
3. **Expiration** – If an `expires_at` timestamp is set, the middleware rejects the key after that date, deactivates it on first use after expiry, and returns a 401 error.
4. **Revocation** – A key can be deactivated at any time via `DELETE /api/v1/api-keys/:id`. The `is_active` flag is cleared, causing subsequent requests to be rejected with a 401.
5. **Rotation** – To rotate a key, call `POST /api/v1/api-keys/:id/rotate`. A new plain‑text key is returned and the stored hash is replaced. The old key becomes immediately invalid. Update the consuming service's configuration with the new key, verify functionality, and optionally keep the old key for a short rollback window before fully deactivating it.

## Scope Reference Table

| Scope Pattern | Meaning |
|---------------|---------|
| `resource:action` | Grants exactly the specified action on the given resource (e.g., `contracts:read`). |
| `resource:*` | Grants all actions on the specified resource (e.g., `contracts:*`). |
| `*:action` | Grants the action on **any** resource (e.g., `*:read`). |
| `*` | Grants full access; should only be used for admin keys. |

> **Note:** Scopes are validated in `src/auth/apiKeyMiddleware.ts` and must match one of the above patterns.

## Rotation Process Checklist

- [ ] Call the rotate endpoint and capture the new plain‑text key.
- [ ] Update the service configuration (env var, secret store) with the new key.
- [ ] Deploy the updated configuration.
- [ ] Verify that requests succeed with the new key.
- [ ] Monitor logs for any authentication failures.
- [ ] (Optional) Keep the old key active for a brief period to allow rollback, then deactivate it.

## Error Responses

### Authentication Errors
```json
{ "error": "Missing X-API-Key header" }
```
```json
{ "error": "Invalid API key" }
```
### Authorization Errors
```json
{ "error": "Forbidden: insufficient API key scope", "required": "contracts:read", "provided": ["users:read"] }
```
### Validation Errors
```json
{ "error": "Invalid request body", "required": { "name": "string", "scope": "string[]" } }
```

## Implementation Details

### Hashing Algorithm
- **Algorithm**: PBKDF2
- **Iterations**: 10,000
- **Salt Length**: 16 bytes (32 hex chars)
- **Key Length**: 64 bytes (128 hex chars)
- **Hash Format**: `salt:hash`

### Database Schema
```typescript
interface ApiKey {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  key_hash: string;        // salt:hash format
  scope: string[];
  created_by: string;
  created_at: Date;
  updated_at: Date;
  expires_at?: Date;
  last_used_at?: Date;
  is_active: boolean;
}
```

### Middleware Integration
```typescript
import { authenticateApiKey, requireApiKeyScope } from './auth/apiKeyMiddleware';

// API key authentication only
app.get('/api/internal', authenticateApiKey, handler);

// API key with scope validation
app.get('/api/contracts',
  authenticateApiKey,
  requireApiKeyScope('contracts', 'read'),
  handler
);

// Either JWT or API key
app.get('/api/mixed',
  authenticateEither,
  handler
);
```

## Migration Guide

### From JWT to API Keys
1. Identify service‑to‑service communication.
2. Create API keys with appropriate scopes.
3. Update clients to use `X-API-Key` header.
4. Remove JWT authentication from service accounts.
5. Monitor and test the new authentication flow.

### Key Rotation Process
1. Generate new key using rotation endpoint.
2. Update service configuration with new key.
3. Test new key functionality.
4. Deploy updated configuration.
5. Monitor for any authentication failures.
6. Keep old key temporarily for rollback.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Key not working** – Verify the key is copied correctly (no extra spaces), check expiration, ensure the key is still active, and verify required scope matches.
- **Scope errors** – Check exact scope format, ensure wildcards are used correctly, and verify the key has necessary permissions.
- **Performance issues** – Monitor key validation time, consider database indexing for key lookups, and implement caching for frequently validated keys.

### Debug Information
Enable debug logging to trace authentication flow:
```typescript
// In development
console.log('API Key validation:', { keyId, scope, timestamp });
```
